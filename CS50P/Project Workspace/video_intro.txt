hello! this is my final project for cs50p. it consists of a few minigames that i, with no prior coding experience, could manage with
and a scoresheet to keep track of scores. the code is probably very unoptimised but i did what i could :P
(i spent way too much time on the coding so ill make this video short and quick)
