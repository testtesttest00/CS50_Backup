On a 3D graph of axes energy, danceability and valence, I would determine the spot the listener occupies based on the averages of their songs.
The graph would have two pre-determined moods at each points and the listener will take the moods from the nearest mood-point on the graph.

A limitation to this approach is in the use of average, which could cause a listener who listens to songs with extreme differences in a characteristic
(e.g. some songs that have very high energy and other songs with very low energy) to be wrongly classified as listening to songs with a middle value
in that characteristic. A way to overcome this is to also check for variance in values and plot the listener on multiple points of the graph which
returns multuple aura moods that can be joined together to give the prominent 2 moods.
