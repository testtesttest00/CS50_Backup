hello! this is my final project for cs50x. my project is an extension of what i did in my final project in cs50p, where i built a
minigame player consisting of 3 games on python. for cs50x, i focused on adding a new game, 15 puzzle, where a grid of 4x4 tiles are
scrambled and players have to slide a blank tile to reorganise the grid. in order to show my growth in cs50p, i also implemented the
game on c and on html with the help of flask and sql. i wanted to make use of every new language introduced to me during the course
for this final project.
