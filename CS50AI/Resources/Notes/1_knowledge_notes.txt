        Model - Assignment of bool value to every propositional symbol (e.g. model_1={P:True,Q:False}, model_2={P:True,Q:True})
        Knowledge base (KB) - Set of sentences known to the agent (e.g. {¬P → Q, P})
        Entailment - A ⊨ B : Every model resulting in the set of sentences A to be true, also makes sentence B true (e.g. P ⊨ P ∨ Q)
        Inference - Deriving new sentences from old ones (e.g. KB={P, Q, P ∧ Q → R} Inference={R})

    First-Order Logic:
        Propositional Symbol - Cat_Home, Cat_Park, Dog_Home, Dog_Park
        First-Order Symbol:
            Constant Symbol (Variables) - Cat, Dog, Home, Park
            Predicate Symbol (Predictive functions) - CurrentLocation, IsAnimal, IsLocation
            Usage:
                IsAnimal(Cat) == true                - Cat is an animal
                ¬IsLocation(Cat) == true             - Cat is not a location
                CurrentLocation(Dog, Home) == true   - Dog is currently at Home
                ¬CurrentLocation(Cat, Park) == true  - Cat is currently not at Park
        Quantification:
            (P is the predicate, x is a set of constants/predicate variables)
            Universal Quantifier - ∀:
                ∀xP(x) - Returns true if P(x) is true for all values of x
                    e.g. ∀xIsAnimal(x)                     - Is true if all constant symbol x are animals: x is the set of animals
                         ∀xIsAnimal(x) → ¬∀xIsLocation(x)  - For every constant symbol x that is an animal, it is not a location
            Existential Quantifier - ∃:
                ∃xP(x) - Returns true if P(x) is true for at least one value of x
                    e.g. ∃xCurrentLocation(x, Home)                - Is true if at least one x is at home: x has a symbol now at home
                         ∃xCurrentLocation(x, Home) ∧ IsAnimal(x)  - For at least one constant symbol x, x is an animal now at home
            Both quantifiers can be used together
                e.g. ∀xIsLocation(x) → (∃yIsAnimal(y) ∧ CurrentLocation(y, x)) - For all locations x, minimally one animal y is there

Inference Algorithm:
    Check if KB ⊨ A

    Method - Model Checking:
    1. Enumerate every possible models (e.g. for P, Q, test {P:True, Q:False}, {P:False,Q:True}, {P:False, Q:False} & {P:True Q:True})
    2. When each model results in KB being True, check if A is True (If every model is so, KB ⊨ A)

    e.g.
    P: It is 2024, Q: It is September 29th, R: It is 290924
    KB: (P ∧ Q) ↔ R, R
    Query: Q


    1. Enumarate all models:

    It is 2024 // It is September 29th // It is 290924
    False      // False                // False
    False      // False                // True
    False      // True                 // True
    True       // True                 // True
    True       // True                 // False
    True       // False                // False
    False      // True                 // False
    True       // False                // True


    2.1. Check if KB is True

    It is 2024 // It is September 29th // It is 290924 // Truths
    False      // False                // False        //
    False      // False                // True         //     R
    False      // True                 // True         //   Q R
    True       // True                 // True         // P Q R (P ∧ Q) (P ∧ Q) ↔ R
    True       // True                 // False        // P Q   (P ∧ Q)
    True       // False                // False        // P
    False      // True                 // False        //   Q
    True       // False                // True         // P   R

    It is 2024 // It is September 29th // It is 290924 // KB = {(P ∧ Q) ↔ R, R}
    False      // False                // False        // False
    False      // False                // True         // False
    False      // True                 // True         // False
    True       // True                 // True         // True
    True       // True                 // False        // False
    True       // False                // False        // False
    False      // True                 // False        // False
    True       // False                // True         // False


    2.2. For each KB = {(P ∧ Q) ↔ R, R} == True, check if A = Q == True

    It is 2024 // It is September 29th // It is 290924 // KB = {(P ∧ Q) ↔ R, R}
    True       // True                 // True         // True

     P  //   Q  //  R  // KB = {(P ∧ Q) ↔ R, R}
    ... // True // ... //  True


    Conclusion: {(P ∧ Q) ↔ R, R} ⊨ {Q}


    * during this example, tested that it is not enough to use {(P ∧ Q) → R, R} to prove {(P ∧ Q) → R, R} ⊨ {Q}
    new example from altering the lecture's example:
    P: It is a Tuesday   Q: It is raining   R: Harry will go for a run
    Lecture KB: (P ∧ ¬Q) → R, P , ¬Q  Query: R  >> works to prove entailment {(P ∧ ¬Q) → R, R}
    Experiment KB: (P ∧ ¬Q) → R, R

    P     // Q     // R     // Truths
    False // False // False //       ¬Q          (P ∧ ¬Q) → R

    True  // True  // True  // True
    False // True  // True  // True
    False // False // False // True
    True  // False // True  // True

    Cannot conclude {(P ∧ ¬Q) → R, R} ⊨ {P}

    Explanation:
        Using →, Even if A = false, B = true, relationship A → B still holds true.
        This is because B may have "multple swithches".
        C may be the switch used to turn on B, but that does not mean A is not connected to B.

        Knowing that, R may be true even if (P ∧ ¬Q) is false. Harry could have ran on a rainy day that is not Tuesday.

        Without certainty that R occurred due to (P ∧ ¬Q), by the definition of entailment
        (A set of sentences (called premises) logically entails a sentence (called a conclusion)
        if and only if every truth assignment that satisfies the premises also satisfies the conclusion),
        {(P ∧ ¬Q) → R, R} (the premise) does not entail {P} (the conclusion).

Inference Rules:
    Modus Ponens
        If A then B (A → B)  >>  Given A = true, conclude B = true
        e.g. If button is pushed then it turns red. Given button pushed, conclude it turned red
    And Elimination
        A and B (A ∧ B) >> Given A ∧ B == true, conclude A = true
        e.g. Given I have a box of chocolate and candy, conclude I have chocolate in a box.
    Double Negation Elimination
        Not not A (¬¬A) >> Given ¬¬A = true, conclude A = true
        e.g. Given not true I do not have a box of chocolate, conclude I have a box of chocolate.
    Implication Elimination
        A imply B (A → B) >> Given A → B = true, conclude ¬A ∨ B = true
        e.g. Given switch A turns light B on, only time statement is false is {switch on (¬A = not true) ∨ light off (B = false)}
    Biconditional Elimination
        A if and only if B (A ↔ B) >> Given A ↔ B = true, conclude A → B = true ∧ B → A = true
        e.g. Only switch A turns light B on. Given light is on, switch must be one, vice-versa
    De Morgan's Law
        Not A and B (¬(A ∧ B)) >> Given ¬(A ∧ B) == true, conclude ¬A ∨ ¬B
        e.g. Given not true both A and B passed a test, conclude either A, or B, or both A and B did not pass.
    Distributive Property
        (A ∧ (B ∨ C)) == (A ∧ B) ∨ (A ∧ C)
        e.g. I like chicken want mash potato or fries == I want chicken and mash potato or I want chicken and fries
        (A ∨ (B ∧ C)) == (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C)
        e.g. I want chicken or fish and beans == I want chicken or fish and I want chicken or beans

Search Algorithm to Prove using Knowledge:
    Initial State - Knowledge base
    Goal State - Knowledge base entails query/proves query or no more inference possible
    Actions - Inference rules
    Transition Model - Updated knowledge base with inferences
    Path Cost - Number of steps in proof

Resolution:
    1.    P ∨ Q1 ∨ Q2 ∨ ... ∨ Qn >> Given ¬P == true, conclude Q1 ∨ Q2 ∨ ... ∨ Qn == true
    2.    P ∨ Q1 ∨ Q2 ∨ ... ∨ Qn >> Given ¬P ∨ R1 ∨ R2 ∨ ... ∨ Rm == true, conclude Q1 ∨ Q2 ∨ ... ∨ Qn ∨ R1 ∨ R2 ∨ ... ∨ Rm == true

Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):
    Clause - a disjunction of literals (e.g. P ∨ Q ∨ R)
    CNF - a conjunction of clauses (e.g. (A ∨ B ∨ C) ∧ (X ∨ Y))

    Every sentence can be converted into CNF:
        Eliminate biconditionals using: P ↔ Q >> (P → Q) ∧ (Q → P)
        Eliminate implications using: P → Q >> ¬P ∨ Q
        Distribute NOTs as seen in: ¬(P ∧ Q) >> ¬P ∨ ¬Q
        Distribute connectives as in: P ∧ (Q ∨ R) >> (P ∧ Q) ∨ (P ∧ R) & P ∨ (Q ∧ R) >> (P ∨ Q) ∧ (P ∨ R)

Inference Algorithm 2:
    Check if KB ⊨ A by contradiction of (KB ∧ ¬A)

    Method - Inference by Resolution:
    1.    Convert (KB ∧ ¬A) to Conjuctive Normal Form (CNF) using inference rules
    2.1.  Resolve clauses and add new resolved clause onto CNF using resolution rules (To mix-and-match every clause permutation)
    2.2.  Test if empty clause/false can be reached (e.g. P ∧ ¬P >> ( )/false) (( ) - contradiction proven and conclude P ⊨ P)

    (During resolution: (P ∧ ¬P) >> False, ⊥ == ( ), (P ∨ ¬P) >> True, ⊤ (Tautology))

    e.g. KB = {(B → A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C}


    1.    Convert (KB ∧ ¬A) to Conjuctive Normal Form (CNF) using inference rules

    KB ∧ ¬A
    (B → A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A
    (¬B ∨ A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A


    2.1.  Resolve clauses and add new resolved clause onto CNF using resolution rules (To mix-and-match every clause permutation)

    (¬B ∨ A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A
    (¬B ∨ A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A ∧ (A ∨ C) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A
    (¬B ∨ A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A ∧ (A ∨ C) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A ∧ A
    (¬B ∨ A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A ∧ (A ∨ C) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A ∧ A ∧ ( )

    2.2.  Test if empty clause/false can be reached (Tested every iteration above, reached after 3 iterations)

    (¬B ∨ A) ∧ (C ∨ B) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A  >>  (A ∨ C) ∧ ¬C ∧ ¬A  >>  A ∧ ¬A  >>  ( )
    Contradiction Found: True


    Conclude: KB ⊨ A


    * resolution and inference rules are different
    e.g. (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬A
    Inference (distributive property): (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬A  >>  (A ∧ ¬A) ∨ (B ∧ ¬A)
    Resolution:                        (A ∨ B) ∧ ¬A  >>  B

i need a help with logical fallacies. there is this sentence:
"If it does not rain, Harry visits Hagrid today"

given that:
it does not rain

i can conclude:
Harry visits Hagrid

however is this the only conclusion i can safely draw without doubt?
-
ChatGPT said:
In the sentence "If it does not rain, Harry visits Hagrid today," you're dealing with a conditional statement (an "if-then" statement).
Given that "it does not rain," you can safely conclude that "Harry visits Hagrid today" is true based on that conditional.

However, it's important to note that this conclusion assumes that the conditional statement is the only determining factor.
In logical terms, this is known as affirming the antecedent, which is valid reasoning.

That said, the conditional does not rule out other possibilities. For example, Harry could visit Hagrid for reasons unrelated to
the weather, or he might choose not to visit Hagrid for other reasons. Thus, while you can conclude that "Harry visits Hagrid today"
is true under the given condition, it’s not the only possible scenario.
The conclusion is valid, but there may be additional context that influences whether Harry actually visits Hagrid or not.
-
You said:
given a scenario that removes all other factors, such that rain is the only factor determining harry visiting hagrid,
i wanted to draw logical conclusions given a truth.
so far i have determined that "if not rain->visits hagrid". i wanted to confirm that: "if rains-> may or may not visit hagrid" is true,
"hagrid was visited-> may or may not have rained" is true, and "hagrid was not visited-> may or may not have rained" is true
-
ChatGPT said:
Your reasoning is correct based on the scenario you've established where rain is the only factor determining whether
Harry visits Hagrid. Let’s break down the statements:

If it rains → may or may not visit Hagrid: True. If it rains, we can't definitively conclude whether Harry visits Hagrid or not,
since rain is the only factor, but other reasons might exist for him to visit or not.

If Hagrid was visited → may or may not have rained: True. If Harry visited Hagrid, it could have been because it didn’t rain,
but we can't rule out the possibility that he visited for another reason despite the rain.

If Hagrid was not visited → may or may not have rained: True. If Harry did not visit Hagrid, it might be because it rained,
but there could also be other reasons for his decision.

In summary, all your conclusions hold true given the scenario where rain is the only factor determining Harry's visit.
Your logic is sound!
-
You said:
my friend is insisting to me that if hagrid was not visited, it must not have rained. what type of fallacy or error is he making?
-
ChatGPT said:
Your friend is committing the fallacy of denying the antecedent. This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that if the
condition in an "if-then" statement is not met (in this case, if Hagrid was not visited), then the result must also not occur
(i.e., it must have rained).

In logical terms, the original statement is: "If it does not rain (antecedent), then Harry visits Hagrid (consequent)."
Your friend is incorrectly assuming that if the consequent (visiting Hagrid) is false, the antecedent (it does not rain) must
also be false.

In reality, there can be other reasons why Harry might not visit Hagrid, even if it did not rain. So, your friend's reasoning
is flawed because it overlooks these possibilities.
-
You said:
how can the original statement be altered to make the if-then bidirectional
-
ChatGPT said:
To make the original statement bidirectional, you can use a biconditional statement.
In logic, a biconditional statement indicates that both conditions must either be true or false together.

The original statement is: "If it does not rain, then Harry visits Hagrid today."

To make it bidirectional, you can rephrase it as:

"Harry visits Hagrid today if and only if it does not rain."

This means:

If it does not rain, then Harry visits Hagrid.
If Harry visits Hagrid, then it does not rain.
In this form, both conditions are interdependent, and you cannot have one true without the other.
-
You said:
if i were to give a truth: harry did not visit hagrid, can i safely determine that it rained, using this new statement
-
ChatGPT said:
Yes, if you use the bidirectional statement "Harry visits Hagrid today if and only if it does not rain,"
then you can conclude that if "Harry did not visit Hagrid," it must have rained.

In this case:

The truth of "Harry did not visit Hagrid" implies that the antecedent of the biconditional ("it does not rain") is false.
Therefore, it logically follows that "it rained."
So, under this biconditional framework, you can safely determine that it rained if Harry did not visit Hagrid.
-
You said:
if and only if

must this be used in whole? can i shorten it to "only if" without changing its meaning?
-
ChatGPT said:
The phrase "if and only if" (often abbreviated as "iff") conveys a biconditional relationship,
meaning both conditions are true together or false together.

You cannot shorten it to just "only if" without changing its meaning.

"If A, then B" means B is true whenever A is true, but A can be false while B is true.
"B only if A" means B can only be true when A is true, but it doesn't imply that if B is false, A must also be false.
So, for a biconditional relationship, you need to use "if and only if" to maintain the equivalence between the two statements.
-
You said:
shouldnt "B only if A" mean B can be true only if A is true, rather than B can only be true if A is true
-
ChatGPT said:
You're correct in your understanding!

The phrase "B only if A" means that B can be true only when A is true. In other words, if A is false, then B must also be false.

So to clarify:

"B only if A" means that B is contingent on A being true. If A is false, B cannot be true.
Thank you for catching that! It’s an important distinction in understanding conditional statements.
-
You said:
so with this new conclusion, will B only if A be a bidirectional statement?
-
ChatGPT said:
No, "B only if A" is not a bidirectional statement; it is a conditional statement.

Here's the breakdown:

"B only if A" means that if B is true, then A must also be true. However, it doesn't imply that if A is true,
then B must be true. In other words, A being true doesn't guarantee that B is true.
For a statement to be bidirectional (like "if and only if"), both conditions must depend on each other:

"B if and only if A" means:
If A is true, then B is true.
If B is true, then A is true.
So, "B only if A" is a one-way condition, while "B if and only if A" is a two-way condition.

to condense and summarise the information, is this table accurate?

"B if A" == "if A then B"
Given   // Conclusion
-----------------------
A true  // B true
A false // B unknown
B true  // A unknown
B false // A unknown

"B only if A"
Given   // Conclusion
-----------------------
B true  // A true
B false // A unknown
A true  // B unknown
A false // B unknown

"B if and only if A"
Given   // Conclusion
-----------------------
A true  // B true
A false // B false
B true  // A true
B false // A false
-
ChatGPT said:
Your table is mostly accurate, but let's clarify a few points for better precision. Here’s a revised version:

"B if A" (or "If A, then B")
Given // Conclusion
A true // B true A false // B unknown B true // A unknown B false // A false

"B only if A"
Given // Conclusion
B true // A true B false // A unknown A true // B unknown A false // B false

"B if and only if A" (B iff A)
Given // Conclusion
A true // B true A false // B false B true // A true B false // A false

Notes:
"B if A" implies that if A is true, then B must be true, but if A is false, we can't conclude anything about B.
"B only if A" indicates that B can only be true if A is true. If B is false, A must be false, but if A is true,
B might still be unknown (e.g., it could be true or false based on other factors).
"B if and only if A" clearly establishes that both conditions are equivalent.
Overall, your summary is quite good, and just a few adjustments clarify the relationships!

You said:
sorry but could you format the table by breaking lines in between rows

Sure! Here’s the complete presentation with the tables and notes included as a footer:

"B if A" (or "If A, then B")
Given	Conclusion
A true	B true
A false	B unknown
B true	A unknown
B false	A false
"B only if A"
Given	Conclusion
B true	A true
B false	A unknown
A true	B unknown
A false	B false
"B if and only if A" (B iff A)
Given	Conclusion
A true	B true
A false	B false
B true	A true
B false	A false
Notes:
"B if A" implies that if A is true, then B must be true, but if A is false, we can't conclude anything about B.
"B only if A" indicates that B can only be true if A is true. If B is false, A must be false, but if A is true,
B might still be unknown (e.g., it could be true or false based on other factors).
"B if and only if A" clearly establishes that both conditions are equivalent.
Let me know if you need any further adjustments!

i wanted to apply the info from our previous conversation:
to quote your text:"In logical terms, the original statement is: "If it does not rain (antecedent),
then Harry visits Hagrid (consequent)." Your friend is incorrectly assuming that if the consequent (visiting Hagrid) is false,
the antecedent (it does not rain) must also be false."

however in the above table under "if A then B", given B false, A was concluded to be false. why is this so?
-
ChatGPT said:
Great observation! Let's clarify that.

In the context of "If A, then B" (which can also be written as "A implies B"), if A is true, then B must also be true.
However, if B is false, we can conclude that A must be false as well. This is known as modus tollens:

If A (it does not rain), then B (Harry visits Hagrid).
If B is false (Harry did not visit Hagrid), then A must also be false (it must have rained).
So, in the table under "If A, then B," the reasoning holds correctly that if B is false, A must be false.

In the previous discussion, your friend's error was in thinking that if Harry did not visit Hagrid (B is false),
that means it must not have rained (the opposite of A). In logical terms, we can't definitively say that if B is false,
then A is true; we can only conclude that A must be false if B is false.

So, to summarize:

"If A, then B" allows us to conclude A is false when B is false.
Your friend mistakenly believed the opposite.
Thank you for bringing up this important clarification!

hello, i read a sentence:
"If it does not rain, Harry visits Hagrid today."
i wanted to ask: given that harry did not visit hagrid today can i conclude that it rained?
i read about modus tollens so that conclusion should hold true.
however, "If it does not rain, Harry visits Hagrid today" does not eliminate the possibility of
"If it rains, Harry still visits Hagrid anyway", making me confused
-
ChatGPT said:
You're correct in identifying that the statement "If it does not rain, Harry visits Hagrid today" is a conditional statement.
In terms of logic, this is often represented as:

𝑃: It does not rain.
𝑄: Harry visits Hagrid today.
The statement can be expressed as 𝑃→𝑄 (if 𝑃 is true, then 𝑄 is true).

Modus tollens states that if you have 𝑃→𝑄 and you know that 𝑄 is false
(in your case, Harry did not visit Hagrid), you can conclude that 𝑃 is also false (it rained).

However, your confusion arises from the fact that the statement does not exclude the possibility of Harry visiting Hagrid if it rains.
The original statement only addresses what happens if it does not rain;
it does not provide information about what happens if it does rain. Therefore, while you can conclude that it must have rained
(because Harry did not visit Hagrid), it doesn't mean that Harry visiting Hagrid in the rain is impossible—it simply wasn't covered
by the original statement.

In summary, based on the logic provided, you can conclude that it rained,
but that doesn't eliminate other possibilities about Harry's actions when it rains.
-
You said:
i was thinking if harry did not visit hagrid, i cannot assume it rains because i thought he could still visit under the rain.
however i neglected the fact that if harry does not visit hagrid, there is no other explanation than it raining - if it does not rain,
he has to go.
-
ChatGPT said:
Exactly! You’ve grasped it well. The key point is that the statement only guarantees that if it does not rain,
Harry will definitely visit Hagrid. If he didn’t visit, then the only logical conclusion based on that statement is that
it must have rained.

Your initial thought about Harry potentially visiting Hagrid in the rain is valid, but it doesn’t affect the conclusion we
draw from the original statement. The conditional only tells us what happens in the case of no rain. Since he didn’t visit,
it leaves no other option than that it rained. Great reasoning!
-
You said:
i am also curious about modus tollens, how it applies to the real world and what uncertainties it faces in application
-
ChatGPT said:
Modus tollens is a fundamental logical rule that states:

If 𝑃 (the premise) is true, then 𝑄 (the conclusion) is also true: 𝑃→𝑄.
If 𝑄 is false, then 𝑃 must also be false: ¬𝑄→¬𝑃.
In real-world applications, modus tollens is a useful tool for reasoning and drawing conclusions based on given premises.
Here are a few ways it can apply:

Real-World Applications
Scientific Reasoning: Scientists use it to test hypotheses. If a theory predicts a specific outcome
(if it rains, then the ground will be wet), and the outcome does not occur (the ground is dry), the theory can be challenged.

Everyday Decision-Making: For example, if you think, "If I leave the house by 8 AM, I'll catch the bus," and you miss the bus,
you can conclude that you didn't leave by 8 AM.

Legal Reasoning: In law, if a certain condition implies a legal consequence, and that consequence does not occur,
it can indicate the condition was not met.

Uncertainties in Application
Incomplete Information: In real-life situations, premises may not be complete. For example, if you say,
"If it rains, the picnic is canceled," and the picnic isn’t canceled, you can’t conclude that it didn’t rain—it
could have rained but other factors (like a change of plans) might have affected the outcome.

Ambiguity of Conditions: The conditions in real-life statements can be ambiguous. For example, "If I study hard, I'll pass the exam."
If you don’t pass, it doesn’t necessarily mean you didn’t study hard; there could be other reasons.

Multiple Causes: In many cases, multiple factors can lead to the same outcome. For example, a person might fail a test due to
lack of study or illness. If they fail, you can’t definitively conclude which cause led to the failure.

Context Dependence: The truth of premises can vary based on context. For instance, "If I eat gluten, I'll feel sick" might hold
true for someone with celiac disease but not for someone without gluten sensitivity.

Conclusion
While modus tollens is a powerful logical tool, its application in the real world must be done carefully, considering the context
and potential uncertainties. It's important to recognize that while logic provides clarity,
real-world situations often involve complexities that go beyond simple conditional statements.

hello, i wanted to ask about deductive logic. "If it does not rain, Harry visit Hagrid today", i can make these conclusions right?

Given -> Conclude
--------------------
no rain -> visited
rain -> unknown
visited -> no rain
not visited -> rain
-
ChatGPT said:
Your deductions are mostly on the right track, but let's clarify the relationships:

If it does not rain, then Harry visits Hagrid today.
This is a conditional statement (if A, then B):
A = "It does not rain"
B = "Harry visits Hagrid"
From this, you can conclude:

No rain → Visited (correct)
Rain → Unknown (correct, since we can't determine anything about the visit if it rains)
Visited → No rain (this is not correct; visiting does not necessarily imply no rain unless stated explicitly)
Not visited → Rain (this is correct: if Harry does not visit Hagrid, we can infer it must have rained, based on the original statement).
So, your logic works for the first, second, and last conclusions, but the third one is incorrect.
Great job overall! If you have more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

You said:
if i were to make it a bidirectional statement like "It does not rain if and only if Harry visits Hagrid", i can then conclude:

rain -> not visited
no rain -> visited
visited -> no rain
not visited -> rain
-
ChatGPT said:
You're correct! When you say, "It does not rain if and only if Harry visits Hagrid," it establishes a bidirectional relationship.
Let's break down what this means:

If it does not rain, then Harry visits Hagrid.
If Harry visits Hagrid, then it does not rain.
This gives us the following conclusions:

Rain → Not visited (if it rains, Harry does not visit Hagrid).
No rain → Visited (if it does not rain, Harry visits Hagrid).
Visited → No rain (if Harry visits, it implies it does not rain).
Not visited → Rain (if Harry does not visit, it implies it must have rained).
All your conclusions here are correct! This is a classic example of a biconditional statement.
Nice work! If you have more questions or need further examples, just let me know!

if i have an implication:
if A then B,

i can simplify to:
notA or B

is this true:
A or notB
-
ChatGPT said:
No, the expression 𝐴∨¬𝐵 is not equivalent to the implication 𝐴→𝐵 or its simplified form ¬𝐴∨𝐵.

To clarify:

The implication 𝐴→𝐵 can be expressed as ¬𝐴∨𝐵. The expression 𝐴∨¬𝐵 does not represent the same logical relationship.
Here's a quick breakdown using truth values:

If 𝐴 is true and 𝐵 is true, then both ¬𝐴∨𝐵 and 𝐴∨¬𝐵 are true.
If 𝐴 is true and 𝐵 is false, then ¬𝐴∨𝐵 is false, but 𝐴∨¬𝐵 is true.
If 𝐴 is false and 𝐵 is true, then ¬𝐴∨𝐵 is true, but 𝐴∨¬𝐵 is false.
If 𝐴 is false and 𝐵 is false, both expressions are false.
Thus, the two expressions yield different results in some scenarios, so they are not equivalent.
-
You said:
A -> B
A is true or false:
A v notA
B vnotA

are these the working steps to reach notA v B?
-
ChatGPT said:
To derive ¬𝐴∨𝐵 from the implication 𝐴→𝐵 (which is equivalent to ¬𝐴∨𝐵), you don't need to separately consider 𝐴 being true or false.
However, if you want to use truth values, here's how you might think about it:

Start with the implication: 𝐴→𝐵.
Recall that 𝐴→𝐵 is equivalent to ¬𝐴∨𝐵.
If you analyze the two cases for 𝐴:

Case 1:
𝐴 is true. Then 𝐵 must also be true for 𝐴→𝐵 to hold.
Case 2:
𝐴 is false. Then 𝐴→𝐵 holds regardless of 𝐵 (because a false antecedent makes the implication true).
From this, you can derive:

If 𝐴 is true, 𝐵 is true, contributing to ¬𝐴∨𝐵 being true.
If 𝐴 is false, ¬𝐴 is true, which also satisfies ¬𝐴∨𝐵.
Thus, regardless of whether 𝐴 is true or false, ¬𝐴∨𝐵 will hold, confirming that your original steps lead to the correct conclusion.
However, you can arrive at ¬𝐴∨𝐵 more directly without needing to separately assess the truth values of 𝐴 and 𝐵.

Quack. I am CS50's duck debugger (ddb), an experimental AI for rubberducking. Quack quack. My replies might not always be accurate, so always think critically and let me know if you think that I've erred. Conversations are logged. Quack quack quack.

you
given a knowledge base
{(P ∧ Q) → R, R}, is
{(P ∧ Q) → R, R} ⊨ {Q}
a valid conclusion?
ddb
To determine if ({(P \land Q) \rightarrow R, R} \models {Q}) is a valid conclusion, we need to check if (Q) logically follows from the given knowledge base.

((P \land Q) \rightarrow R) means that if both (P) and (Q) are true, then (R) must be true.
(R) is given as true.
However, from (R) alone, we cannot infer (Q) directly because (R) could be true regardless of the truth values of (P) and (Q). Therefore, ({(P \land Q) \rightarrow R, R} \not\models {Q}) is not a valid conclusion.

you
if P: it is 2024, Q: it is september 29, R: it is 29 september 2024, and i know R is true, using entailment i cannot conclude that Q it is september 29?
ddb
In your example, if (R) (it is 29 September 2024) is true, then both (P) (it is 2024) and (Q) (it is September 29) must also be true. This is because (R) being true implies both (P) and (Q) are true. So, in this specific context, you can conclude that (Q) is true.

you
i was questioning it as {(P ∧ Q) → R, R} does not entail {Q} so knowing R, i cannot conclude Q
ddb
You're correct. In the general case of ({(P \land Q) \rightarrow R, R}), you cannot conclude (Q) just from knowing (R). The truth of (R) alone does not provide enough information to determine the truth of (Q).

you
so how can i conclude Q if i know R : "In your example, if (R) (it is 29 September 2024) is true, then both (P) (it is 2024) and (Q) (it is September 29) must also be true. This is because (R) being true implies both (P) and (Q) are true. So, in this specific context, you can conclude that (Q) is true."
ddb
Let's clarify the distinction:

In the general logical form ({(P \land Q) \rightarrow R, R}), you cannot conclude (Q) from (R) alone because (R) could be true for reasons unrelated to (P \land Q).

However, in your specific example, (R) (it is 29 September 2024) inherently includes both (P) (it is 2024) and (Q) (it is September 29). This is a special case where (R) directly implies both (P) and (Q).

So, in this specific context, knowing (R) allows you to conclude (Q).

you
is the reason for this stems from the fact that generally, A -> B is true even when A is false and B is true? the reason for this relationship on the truth table is because there could be external reasons for B to be true, right? the general logic form told me i cannot safely conclude without external info, but given info now that is A is false, B has to be false, in my example where A = (P ^ Q) and B = (R), if A is false, B is false
ddb
Yes, you're on the right track. In general, (A \rightarrow B) is true if (A) is false or (B) is true. This means (B) can be true due to reasons unrelated to (A).

In your example, ((P \land Q) \rightarrow R) is true if ((P \land Q)) is false or (R) is true. Knowing (R) alone doesn't tell us about (P) or (Q) without additional context. However, in your specific case, (R) (it is 29 September 2024) inherently includes both (P) and (Q), allowing you to conclude (Q).

you
is R inherently including P and Q a sort of relationship with a name? its not entailment is it?
ddb
The relationship you're describing is often referred to as a biconditional relationship. In this case, (R) (it is 29 September 2024) is true if and only if both (P) (it is 2024) and (Q) (it is September 29) are true. This can be expressed as (R \leftrightarrow (P \land Q)). This is stronger than simple entailment because it implies a two-way dependency.

you
i see. thanks for the explanation
ddb
You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

you
back to the earlier conversation,  i have altered my knowledge base a little. now, can {(P ∧ Q) ↔ R, R} ⊨ {Q} be safely conclude?
ddb
Yes, with the biconditional ((P \land Q) \leftrightarrow R) and knowing (R) is true, you can safely conclude (Q). This is because (R) being true implies that both (P) and (Q) are true

you
i see. thanks for helping

you
what is the definition of logical entailment
ddb
Logical entailment refers to a relationship between statements where if one statement (or set of statements) is true, then another statement must also be true. In formal terms, a statement ( P ) logically entails a statement ( Q ) if and only if there is no possible situation in which ( P ) is true and ( Q ) is false. This is often denoted as ( P \models Q ).

you
in that case, if all cases where P is true and   Q is true, is true, yet there may be cases where Q is true but P is false, does P still entail Q?
ddb
Yes, ( P ) still entails ( Q ) in that case. Logical entailment only requires that whenever ( P ) is true, ( Q ) must also be true. It does not require ( Q ) to be false when ( P ) is false.

in resolution, do i use the distributive property?

if i had:
(A or B) and (not A), i can resolve it to B

but if i distribute, it becomes
(A and notA) or (B and notA) which is B and notA, which does not seems to resolve anything
ddb
It looks like you're working on logical resolution in propositional logic. You don't need to use the distributive property here. Instead, focus on the resolution rule directly.

Given:

( A \lor B )
( \neg A )
You can resolve these by noting that ( A ) and ( \neg A ) cancel each other out, leaving you with ( B ).

Does that help clarify things?

you
rather than a "don't need" to use the distributive property, its more like a "cannot" right? they are two totally different action right?
ddb
Yes, you're correct. The distributive property and the resolution rule are indeed two different actions. The distributive property is used to manipulate logical expressions algebraically, while the resolution rule is a specific inference rule used in propositional logic to derive conclusions. In the context of resolution, you cannot use the distributive property to achieve the same result.
