user: token_list = tf.keras.backend.get_value(inputs.input_ids)
 If inputs.input_ids is an eagertensor, how do i grt the list of values properly

assistant: To get the list of values from an eager tensor in TensorFlow, you can use the `.numpy()` method. For example:

```python
token_list = inputs.input_ids.numpy()
```

This will convert the eager tensor to a NumPy array, which you can then convert to a list if needed

user: how do i convert it into a list

assistant: To convert the NumPy array to a list, you can use the `.tolist()` method:

```python
token_list = inputs.input_ids.numpy().tolist()
```

This will give you a Python list of the values.

user: if inputs is a baseencoding object, is     token_id_list = inputs.input_ids.numpy().tolist()[0]
the best way to get the inputs_id list?

assistant: If `inputs` is a `BaseEncoding` object, you can directly access the `input_ids` attribute, which is typically already a list or can be converted to one. 

```python
token_id_list = inputs.input_ids[0]
```

If `input_ids` is a tensor, then converting it as you mentioned is appropriate:

```python
token_id_list = inputs.input_ids.numpy().tolist()[0]
```

Make sure to check the type of `input_ids` to determine the best approach.

user: input_ids is an eagertensor

assistant: If `input_ids` is an eager tensor, then your approach is correct:

```python
token_id_list = inputs.input_ids.numpy().tolist()[0]
```

This will convert the eager tensor to a list and then access the first element.

user: ok thanks

assistant: Got it! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

user: gray = round((attention_score * 255).numpy())
If attentention-score is a tf.eagertensor, attention_score*255 is also an eagertensor, is numpy of that a numpy array? and if round(numpy array) dooes it automatIcally become a int?

assistant: Yes, if `attention_score` is a `tf.EagerTensor`, then `attention_score * 255` will also be an eager tensor. When you call `.numpy()` on it, it will convert to a NumPy array. 

Using `round()` on a NumPy array will not automatically convert it to an integer. Instead, you should convert the value to a scalar first:

```python
gray = round((attention_score * 255).numpy().item())
```

This will ensure `gray` is an integer.

user: somehow type(gray) is an int for me. Is it because attention_score is shape ()

assistant: Yes, if `attention_score` has a shape of `()`, it means it's a scalar tensor. When you call `.numpy()` on a scalar tensor, it directly converts to a scalar value, which is why `type(gray)` is an `int`.

user: what does .item do to a non scalar tensor

assistant: The `.item()` method converts a single-element tensor to a standard Python scalar. If you use `.item()` on a non-scalar tensor, it will raise an error.

user: So tf.constant([1,2,3]).item() gives an error?

assistant: Yes, `tf.constant([1, 2, 3]).item()` will give an error because `.item()` can only be used on tensors with a single element.

user: Is tf.constant([1]) already scalar? Or is its shape (1,)

assistant: `tf.constant([1])` is not a scalar; its shape is `(1,)`. A scalar tensor would be created with `tf.constant(1)`, which has shape `()`.

user: a scalar tensor will automatically turn into a python int? and can a scalar tensor be used like an int

assistant: A scalar tensor will convert to a Python int when you call `.numpy()` on it. You can use a scalar tensor in operations like an int, but it remains a tensor until explicitly converted.

user: so to recap if i do tf.constant(1).numpy() it becomes an int of 1

assistant: Yes, `tf.constant(1).numpy()` will convert the tensor to a Python int with the value 1.

user: thanks for explaining

assistant: You're welcome! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.
